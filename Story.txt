Once upon a time.. there was a pig who was lost. She called for help but was met by silence. Eventually she 
heard footsteps behind her and there was a WOLF! She asked for direction since she was lost, but he was hungry. 
She noticed how he glared at her so she began to run. Yelling for help but no one answered her. She continued to 
run but then, she was caught in a trap. She knew that was the end, and accepted her fate. Then there was a lion she 
saw in the in the distance. To her surprise, the lion rescued her and scared the wolf away.
